# RealEstate DApp Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that forms the backbone of a decentralized real estate platform. The system is designed to digitize and automate the end-to-end property transaction process while integrating functionalities for property listing, document verification, escrow-based offers, milestone payments, fractional tokenization, rent distribution, and DAO-based dispute resolution.

## Overview

The smart contract supports multiple roles including:
- **Sellers:** List properties with verified IPFS-based document storage.
- **Buyers:** Browse listings, make offers, and engage in property transactions.
- **Legal Notaries & Registry Officials:** Verify property documents and authenticate listings.
- **Banks:** Process and track mortgage disbursements.
- **Agents:** Assist throughout the transaction process.

Additional functionalities are provided for fractional property ownership, automated rent distribution to tokenized owners, and DAO-based dispute resolution to ensure transparency and minimize fraud.

## Features

- **Role Management:** Utilizes OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to manage distinct roles.
- **Property Listing & Verification:** Sellers list properties by providing a price and an IPFS hash for key documents; verification is handled by authorized officials.
- **Escrow & Milestone Payments:** Buyer offers initiate an escrow process where funds are released gradually based on milestones.
- **Ownership Transfer:** Final ownership transfer is recorded immutably on the blockchain and serves as an update to the land registry.
- **Tokenization & Rent Distribution:** Simulates fractional property ownership through tokenization and distributes rent accordingly.
- **DAO-based Dispute Resolution:** Lays the groundwork for resolving disputes via decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) mechanisms.

## Contract Workflow

1. **Property Listing:**  
   A seller lists a property by calling `listProperty` with a price (e.g., `100 ETH`) and an IPFS document hash (e.g., `"QmXyz123...abc"`).  
   **Event Emitted:** `PropertyListed`

2. **Property Verification:**  
   A notary or registry official verifies the property by calling `verifyProperty` for a given property ID, marking it as verified.  
   **Event Emitted:** `PropertyVerified`

3. **Making an Offer:**  
   A buyer makes an offer by transferring sufficient funds to the smart contract via `makeOffer`. The funds are securely held in escrow for the property.  
   **Events Emitted:** `OfferMade` and `EscrowInitiated`

4. **Milestone Payment Release:**  
   An authorized party (bank or registry official) calls `releaseMilestone` to release the escrow funds incrementally based on predefined milestones.  
   **Event Emitted:** `MilestonePaymentReleased`

5. **Finalizing the Sale:**  
   Once all funds are released, calling `finalizeSale` transfers ownership from the seller to the buyer.  
   **Event Emitted:** `OwnershipTransferred`

6. **Additional Operations:**  
   - **Tokenization:** Sellers can fractionalize their property via `tokenizeProperty` (simulated tokenization).
   - **Rent Distribution:** Automated rent distribution is facilitated using `distributeRent`.
   - **Dispute Resolution:** The `resolveDispute` function is provided as a placeholder for future DAO-based dispute resolution.

## Running the Test :
npx hardhat test


## Explanation:
Detailed Code Explanation
Role Management
AccessControl:
The contract employs OpenZeppelin's AccessControl to set up roles (SELLER, BUYER, NOTARY, BANK, REGISTRY_OFFICIAL). This controls access to functions, ensuring that only authorized entities (e.g., only a registered notary can verify a property) can call specific functions.

Property Lifecycle
Listing & Verification:

listProperty: A seller lists their property by providing a price and an IPFS document hash storing the property-related documents.

verifyProperty: Authorized officials mark a listing as verified after checking the provided documents.

Offers and Escrow:

makeOffer: A buyer initiates an offer by sending funds that are held in escrow. This action records the buyerâ€™s intent and initiates the escrow setup.

Milestone Payments:

releaseMilestone: Facilitates partial release of funds from escrow based on pre-defined milestones. This ensures a controlled release of funds as the transaction process matures.

Finalizing Sales:

finalizeSale: Once the full escrow amount is released, this function transfers the property ownership from the seller to the buyer and concludes the transaction.

Additional Functionalities:

tokenizeProperty: Provides a simulated mechanism for fractional ownership of properties through tokenization.

distributeRent: Simulates the distribution of rent earnings among token holders.

resolveDispute: A placeholder for implementing future DAO-based dispute resolution mechanisms.

Testing Rationale
Each test mimics a real-world scenario, ensuring:

Accurate Event Emission: Events such as PropertyListed, PropertyVerified, OfferMade, EscrowInitiated, MilestonePaymentReleased, and OwnershipTransferred are correctly emitted with the right parameters.

State Validation: The internal state variables (e.g., property ownership, escrow status) are updated as expected after each operation.

Security and Flow: Critical paths (e.g., releasing milestone funds and finalizing transactions) are validated to ensure the smart contract behaves as intended under realistic use cases.
